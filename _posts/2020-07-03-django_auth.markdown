This week was somewhat productive but flow is still somewhat stilted...

I have a skeleton django project created and thanks to some focused coding on Wendesday, I have oAuth authentication via Google, Facebook and Twitter working. Currently thinking about how to structure the data around the techno-economic assessments so I can start getting some traction there. The "simple" spreadsheet tools that I've been looking at demonstrate how completed Excel sheets can get!
